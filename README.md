# SpringRaft

SpringRaft is a dissertation project, which consists in the Raft's consensus algorithm implementation, both in Servlet and Reactive stacks. This implementations should be modular, so that they can be expanded, and should be generic, so that they can be reused in different use cases.

The final purpose of this project is the comparison of the 2 stacks, when applied in this case.

## Repo Structure

Examples and tests built before and after the Raft implementation, are under `test-examples/`.
